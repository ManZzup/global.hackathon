le wild koders
================

Hey folks, meet us le wild koders from Sri Lanka ^_^
Well it's just 'koder' to be exact since I couldn't assemble a team in time :)

ME?
----
I'm a fresher at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Coding is all i do in ma free and not-so-free time :D
Really I have no idea what else to put here, just check my [about.me](http://about.me/manzzup) if you are really really interested ;)

What I want?
------------
From this hackathon, all i want is to make something that would change the existing boring ways (And also I would like some prize :D). From all the hackathon themes the one that got my eye was the one about TOS/Privacy policies. I mean we never read that stuff do we? So that's why [ATOS](https://github.com/ManZzup/ertos) was made.
